# Artifacts Workspace

This directory is intentionally ignored by Git. It is the default drop zone for
all runtime artifacts generated by CapMaster commands, integration scripts, and
manual experiments.

Recommended subdirectories:

- `analysis/` – Markdown/JSON summaries produced by `scripts/analyze_2hops_match.py`
  or manual investigations.
- `benchmarks/` – Raw CLI logs and CSV summaries emitted by
  `scripts/benchmark_2hops.py`.
- `tmp/` – Ad-hoc outputs from local debugging (for example manual topology
  runs, streamdiff comparisons, or pipeline experiments).

Workflow:

1. Run commands and scripts with their outputs pointing inside `artifacts/`.
2. Review the generated files locally.
3. Copy any report that should be versioned into `reports/analysis/` (or another
   tracked location) before committing.

Keeping artifacts isolated makes it easy to clean up temporary data without
touching curated reports or the source tree.
