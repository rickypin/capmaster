## Scalability Analysis

### File Size Scaling

| File Size | Analyze | Match | Filter |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| < 1 MB | ~1s | ~0.5s | ~0.2s |
| 1-10 MB | ~2-5s | ~1-2s | ~0.5-1s |
| 10-100 MB | ~5-20s | ~2-10s | ~1-5s |
| > 100 MB | ~20s+ | ~10s+ | ~5s+ |

**Notes:**
- Times are approximate and depend on content complexity
- Match performance depends on connection count, not just file size
- Filter performance depends on TCP stream count

### Connection Count Scaling (Match)

| Connections | Without Bucketing | With Bucketing |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| < 100 | ~0.5s | ~0.5s |
| 100-1000 | ~2-5s | ~1-2s |
| 1000-10000 | ~20-50s | ~5-10s |
| > 10000 | ~100s+ | ~20-30s |

**Bucketing Impact:**
- Reduces comparison complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)
- Most effective for large datasets (>1000 connections)
- Auto-selection chooses optimal strategy
