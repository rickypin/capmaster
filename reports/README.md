# Reports

Curated, version-controlled reports live here. Copy the vetted outputs you want
to keep (for example, Markdown summaries or comparison tables) from
`artifacts/analysis/` into this directory tree before committing.

Suggested structure:

- `analysis/` – Representative Markdown/JSON reports that document verified
  scenarios or regression baselines.
- Additional subdirectories as needed (for example, `benchmarks/`).

By keeping large, noisy artifacts under `artifacts/` and only promoting the
final versions into `reports/`, the repository stays lean while still
preserving important findings.
